title: A Critique of the Open Letter Calling for the Deplatforming of RMS
sitemap: false
---

Two weeks ago, on March 21, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) announced that he is on the Free
Software Foundation (FSF) board of directors again after having resigned in September
2019\.  Two days later, an [open letter][] condemning RMS as misogynist, ableist,
transphobic, intolerant, bigoted, and hateful was published.  The letter demands
Stallman's removal from all leadership positions as well as the removal of the entire
board of the FSF for enabling such a person.

I will not make an argument either for or against RMS.
I will only argue that the open letter is misleading, divisive, and meant to whip up a
mob.
I think a good argument against RMS *can* be made, but the authors of the letter instead
chose to incite as much outrage as possible at the cost of honesty and nuance.

Many of the letter's signatories tell personal stories of RMS being arrogant, insensitive,
presumptuous, or inappropriate and have concluded that RMS is unsuitable as a leader or
spokesperson.  This is a perfectly justifiable stance to take---especially for those that
experienced or observed misbehavior themselves.  Yet, the letter focuses on what RMS has
said rather than done, and makes accusations that are much more grave.

This hardly seems like an accident.  The goal is to have as many people as
possible---including those that never interacted with RMS---be outraged and sign the
letter, a
strategy that seems to have worked rather well.  It surely also animated some people that
dislike this dynamic to come out in support of RMS.

Let's consider the evidence for RMS being transphobic.  This is thin ice.  The primary
author of the open letter, Molly de Blanc, writes on her personal blog:

> There is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic – if it hurt a trans
> person then it is transphobic and it is unacceptable.

As an aside, I highly recommend reading that blog post in full.  Echoes of its world view
are present throughout the open letter.

So what makes RMS transphobic?
He proposes and uses a set of singular, gender-neutral pronouns other than "they",
"their", and "theirs".[^genderless-pronouns]

One transgender person called the proposal "idiotic", but considers "[c]alling RMS a
transphobe […] an insult to people who suffer from real transphobia."[^leah-rowe] I am
also told of at least one (non-binary) transgender person that does agree with the open
letter's assertion that Stallman's proposal is, in fact, "poorly disguised
transphobia".[^fucking-transphobic] I'm tempted to err on the side of assuming good
intentions here.  To me this looks like Stallman's typical willingness to die on strange,
idiosyncratic hills.  You can have your own opinion.  Or maybe you can't.  Remember, there
"is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic".

The letter correctly quotes RMS saying "the most plausible scenario is that [Virginia
Giuffre] presented herself to [Marvin Minsky] as entirely willing", but then changes
"presented" to "being" when referencing this quote three sentences later.  That same
sentence contains a direct quotation  that is nowhere to be found in the source we're
given.  The letter continues with a parenthetical granting that "several news reports
misrepresented Stallman's position while discussing allegations against Minsky", but then
asserts that "Stallman has previously expressed opinions that were consistent" with these
misrepresentations.  No source is given this time.[^open-letter-appendix]

I doubt that many people looked into all of the accusations before signing the letter.
One of the original signatories told me that, "from a practical perspective, transphobe or
no, [RMS] needs to go"[^luis-1] and that "regardless of exactly how ableist he is, he
can't be a leader of an organization".[^luis-2]  Perhaps that's true, but it isn't fair.
Accusations like ableism and transphobia are front and center in the open letter.
The end shouldn't justify the means.

I'll leave you with three more bits of evidence that things are more complex than the open
letter would have you believe:

1.  A [competing open letter in support of RMS][] exists and has accumulated considerably
    more signatures than the letter condemning RMS.
2.  In response, a Chrome extension was created that displays "RMS Letter Signator" in red
    letters when a repository that belongs to a signatory of the support letter is viewed
    on GitHub.
3.  The [announcement][extension-announcement] of this extension was welcomed with 392
    likes on Twitter.

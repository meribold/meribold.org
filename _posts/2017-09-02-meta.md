A journal of my thoughts while figuring out how to create this static website on [GitHub
Pages][].  Step one is easy: create a repository with the right name.  For me, that's
[meribold/meribold.github.io](https://github.com/meribold/meribold.github.io).

### Jekyll

I think I should use [Jekyll][].  It's suggested at <https://pages.github.com>.  I'm
confused whether this is the only option with GitHub Pages or if there are other
frameworks that can be used.  A Google search for ["blog github pages"][1] mostly results
in matches about Jekyll, but also something about [Pelican][2] and [Hugo][3].  I suppose
options other than Jekyll will require committing the generated HTML pages in addition to
the files used to generate them.

I'll just use Jekyll.  To install it, the [ArchWiki][4] suggests `gem install jekyll`.
There's also a Gem called [`github-pages`][5] that, I think, gives us whatever version of
Jekyll is used on GitHub's side.  Sounds good.

Their [README.md][6] says we need [Bundler][].  The Jekyll ["Quick-start guide"][7] says
so too.  The [ArchWiki][4] and <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/> don't.  Huh.
I'll install it and the `github-pages` Gem.

    $ gem install bundler
    $ gem install github-pages

OK, back to the [guide][7]:

    $ cd meribold.github.io/
    $ jekyll new .
    Conflict: /home/meribold/meribold.github.io exists and is not empty.
    $ jekyll new . --force
    Your user account isn't allowed to install to the system RubyGems.
    You can cancel this installation and run:

        bundle install --path vendor/bundle

    to install the gems into ./vendor/bundle/, or you can enter your password
    and install the bundled gems to RubyGems using sudo.

    Password: ^C

Bail.  Installing stuff outside of `$HOME` with something other than the system package
manager is a mistake I made with [`pip`][pip].

    $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle

OK.

    $ jekyll new . --force

Errors...  let's start over.  I removed everything created by `jekyll new` and `bundle install`.

    $ jekyll new . --force --skip-bundle
    New jekyll site installed in /home/meribold/meribold.github.io.
    Bundle install skipped.

OK.

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Looks promising but <http://localhost:4000> only shows my `index.html` from my initial
commit ([28919f5][]).  Delete it:

    rm index.html

That's better: some kind of demo page ([1327f24][]).

So far, so good.  Let's add this Markdown file as described in
[`_posts/2017-09-02-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown`][welcome-to-jekyll.markdown]
([4f8937c][]).

    mv meta.md _posts/$(date -I)/meta.md

When I serve the site locally, the new post isn't themed yet.  On GitHub it somehow is.
Anyway, it probably needs some front matter: [34c1623][].  That does it.

At this point I looked at and edited all those other files `jekyll new` created.

### Fork the Theme

I want to include the theme in my repository so I can make major changes easily.  This is
covered [here][8].  It's also possible to use a gem-based theme and selectively override
defaults while still getting updates to the theme used.

> [The](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) goal of gem-based themes is to allow you to get
> all the benefits of a robust, continually updated theme without having all the theme's
> files getting in your way and over-complicating what might be your primary focus:
> creating content.

I don't want my theme to randomly change, though (and probably break my overrides in the
process).

    $ bundle show minima
    /home/meribold/.gem/ruby/2.4.0/gems/minima-2.1.1
    $ cp -r /home/meribold/.gem/ruby/2.4.0/gems/minima-2.1.1/* .
    $ git checkout README.md # oops, restory my readme file
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m 'Fork the theme'

See commit [f978760][].

### Destroy

I removed almost everything from the [Minima][minima] theme ([de12477][]).  Time to create
custom styling and figure things out from the ground up.

# Creating a blog with GitHub Pages

Step 1: create a repository with the right name:
[meribold/meribold.github.io](https://github.com/meribold/meribold.github.io).

I think I should use [Jekyll][].  It's suggested at <https://pages.github.com>.  I'm
confused whether this is the only option with GitHub Pages or if there are other
frameworks that can be used.  A Google search for ["blog github pages"][1] mostly results
in matches about Jekyll, but also something about [Pelican][2] and [Hugo][3].

I'll just use Jekyll.  Time to install it.  The [ArchWiki][4] suggests `gem install
jekyll`.  But there's also apparently a Gem called [`github-pages`][5] that, I think,
gives us whatever version of Jekyll is used on GitHub's side.  Sounds good.

Their [README.md][6] says we need Bundler.  The Jekyll ["Quick-start guide"][7] says so
too.  The [ArchWiki][4] and <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/> don't.  Huh.  Let's
install it.

```
gem install bundler
gem install github-pages
```

OK, back to the [guide][7]:

    $ cd meribold.github.io/
    $ jekyll new .
    Conflict: /home/casi/meribold.github.io exists and is not empty.
    $ jekyll new . --force
    Your user account isn't allowed to install to the system RubyGems.
    You can cancel this installation and run:

        bundle install --path vendor/bundle

    to install the gems into ./vendor/bundle/, or you can enter your password
    and install the bundled gems to RubyGems using sudo.

    Password: ^C
    $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
    # OK...
    $ jekyll new . --force
    # errors...

Let's start over.  I removed everything created by `jekyll new` and `bundle install`.

    $ jekyll new . --force --skip-bundle
    New jekyll site installed in /home/casi/meribold.github.io.
    Bundle install skipped.

OK.

    bundle exec jekyll serve

OK, but <http://localhost:4000> only shows my `index.html` from [28919f5][].  Let's delete
it.

    rm index.html

That's better: some kind of demo page.  Time to [commit][1327f24].

So far, so good.  Let's add this Markdown file as described in
`_posts/2017-09-02-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown`.

    mv meta.md _posts/$(date -I)/meta.md

title: A Critique of the Open Letter Calling for the Removal of RMS
changelog: true
---

On March 21, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) announced that he is on the Free Software
Foundation (FSF) board of directors again after having resigned in September 2019.  Two
days later, an [open letter][] condemning RMS as misogynist, ableist, transphobic,
intolerant, bigoted, hateful, and dangerous was published.  The letter demands Stallman's
removal from all leadership positions as well as the removal of the entire board of the
FSF for enabling such a person.

I will not make an argument either for or against RMS.  Those who know RMS personally are
in a better position to do that.  I will only argue that the open letter is misleading,
divisive, and meant to whip up a mob.  I think a good argument against RMS *can* be made,
but the authors of the letter instead chose to incite as much outrage as possible at the
cost of honesty and nuance.

Many of the letter's signatories tell personal stories of RMS being arrogant, insensitive,
presumptuous, or inappropriate, and have concluded that RMS is unsuitable as a leader or
spokesperson.  This is a perfectly justifiable stance to take---especially for those that
experienced or observed misbehavior themselves.  Yet, the letter focuses on what RMS has
said rather than done, and makes accusations that are much more grave.

This hardly seems like an accident.  The goal is to have as many people as
possible---including those that never interacted with RMS---be outraged and sign the
letter, a strategy that seems to have worked rather well.  It surely also animated some
people that dislike this dynamic to come out in support of RMS.

The [letter's appendix][open-letter-appendix] correctly quotes RMS saying "the most
plausible scenario is that [Virginia Giuffre] presented herself to [Marvin Minsky] as
entirely willing", but then changes "presented" to "being" when referencing this quote
three sentences later.  That same sentence contains a direct quotation  that is nowhere to
be found in the source we're given.[^2021-04-16-update]
The appendix continues with a parenthetical granting
that "several news reports misrepresented Stallman's position while discussing allegations
against Minsky", but then asserts that "Stallman has previously expressed opinions that
were consistent with the inaccurate portrayal."  No source is given this time.  On the
other hand, the appendix continues to link one of the misrepresentative news reports.

Let's consider the evidence for RMS being transphobic.  This is thin ice.  The primary
author of the open letter, Molly de Blanc, writes on her personal blog:

> There is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic—if it hurt a trans
> person then it is transphobic and it is unacceptable.  

As an aside, I highly recommend reading [that blog post][] in full.  Echoes of its world
view are present throughout the open letter.

So what makes RMS transphobic?  He [proposes][genderless-pronouns] and uses a set of
singular, gender-neutral pronouns other than "they", "their", and
"theirs".[^2021-05-03-update]

One transgender person [called][leah-rowe] the proposal "idiotic", but
[considers][leah-rowe] "[c]alling RMS a transphobe […] an insult to people who suffer from
real transphobia."  I am also [told of][fucking-transphobic] at least one non-binary
transgender person that does agree with the open letter's assertion that Stallman's
proposal is, in fact, "poorly disguised transphobia".  I'm tempted to err on the side of
assuming good intentions here.  To me this looks like Stallman's typical willingness to
die on strange, idiosyncratic hills.  You can have your own opinion.  Or maybe you can't.
Remember, there "is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic".

The accusation of ableism seems to primarily hinge on a highly insensitive note RMS added
to his website in October 2016, but completely rewrote a few months later.  Presumably
someone told RMS about the problems with his original note.  The open letter's appendix
uses recent web.archive.org links throughout and gives no indication that this particular
link is an outdated capture from 2016.  Here's the [rewritten note][]:

>   A noninvasive test for Down's syndrome eliminates the small risk of the old test.
>   This might lead more women to get tested, and abort fetuses that have Down's syndrome.
>
>   According to Wikipedia, Down's syndrome is a combination of many kinds of medical
>   misfortune.  Thus, when carrying a fetus that is likely to have Down's syndrome, I
>   think the right course of action for the woman is to terminate the pregnancy.
>
>   That choice does right by the potential children that would otherwise likely be born
>   with grave medical problems and disabilities.  As humans, they are entitled to the
>   capacity that is normal for human beings.  I don't advocate making rules about the

RMS has (for some reason) tens of thousands of political notes on his website ready to be
cherry-picked, and yet that wasn't enough for the authors of the open letter and they
turned to an outdated web.archive.org capture from 2016.  And then they didn't bother to
inform the readers of this in any way.

Suggesting that RMS is intolerant is strange.  If anything, he seems to be *too* tolerant.
Implying that RMS is hateful is just ridiculous.

I only looked into some of the open letter's contents in depth and can't comment on the
rest.  Maybe the rest is completely fair.  Martin Tournoij wrote a better and more
thorough [commentary][Stallman isn't great, but not the devil] on the open letter than I
can.  I do wonder how many people looked into the accusations before signing the letter,
though.  One of the original signatories [told me that][luis-1], "from a practical
perspective, transphobe or no, [RMS] needs to go" [and that][luis-2] "regardless of
exactly how ableist he is, he can't be a leader of an organization".  Perhaps that's true,
but it isn't fair.  Accusations like ableism and transphobia are front and center in the
open letter and likely convinced more than a handful of people to add their signature.

I'll leave you with three more bits of evidence that things are more complex than the open
letter would have you believe:

1.  A competing [letter in support of RMS][] exists and has accumulated considerably more
    signatures than the letter condemning RMS.
2.  In response someone created a Chrome extension that marks repositories owned by a
    signatory of this support letter with red text on GitHub.
3.  The [announcement][extension-announcement] of this extension was welcomed with 394
    likes on Twitter.[^twitter-response-clarification]

## Notes

[^2021-04-16-update]: This is still the case as of April 16, but a reader informed me that
    the appendix *used to* provide a different link here.  Instead of a 2021
    web.archive.org capture of a note from Stallman's website it previously linked an old
    version of the same note via a 2018 capture.  The old, since-rewritten note *does*
    contain the phrase "entirely willing".  Presumably the link was [changed][f7d04be] by
    accident.  I'd rather have the appendix rely on outdated notes as little as possible,
    but I've notified two of the people that worked on the appendix in case they want to
    revert the link back to the 2018 capture.

[^2021-05-03-update]: RMS uses "she" and "he" for transgender persons as preferred.  He
    refuses to use singular "they".  I added this note on 2021-05-03 because I noticed
    there's some confusion about this.

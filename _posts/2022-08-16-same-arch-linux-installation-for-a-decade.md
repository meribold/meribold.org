title: Using the Same Arch Linux Installation for a Decade
changelog: true
---

As of today, I've been using the same Arch Linux installation for ten years on my main
computer.  I don't have much to say, but I'm writing this because my experience doesn't
match the common notion that Arch Linux is unstable.[^dont-get-me-wrong]

I installed Arch Linux in August 2012[^systemd] on a ThinkPad X121e and never saw a need
to reinstall.  In 2018, I switched to a ThinkPad X220 by moving my SSD.  A few months ago,
I copied my complete installation to a ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 using rsync.  The longest I went
without a system upgrade is nine months, but typically I upgrade about once per month.

Now it isn't the case that nothing ever broke.  Most disruptively, X did twice and audio
did once.  But over ten years, this doesn't compare too poorly to other operating systems.
With Ubuntu, I would've had to upgrade to a new release at least three times during the
same period to end up with a version that's currently supported,[^precise-to-bionic] and
five times to end up with the latest LTS release.[^precise-to-jammy]  And these release
upgrades don't always go smoothly either.

I don't know what you're using, but I bet you've also spent some time fixing problems with
it over the last ten years.

## Notes

[^dont-get-me-wrong]: I'm not trying to convince anyone to use Arch Linux.
[^systemd]: slightly before systemd became the default init system
[^precise-to-bionic]: from 12.04 to 14.04 to 16.04 to 18.04
[^precise-to-jammy]: from 12.04 to 14.04 to 16.04 to 18.04 to 20.04 to 22.04

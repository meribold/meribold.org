/* Tables

   * Additionally, allow tables to be wider than the main text.  See [3], [4], and
   * especially [5].  FIXME: this breaks when there is a non-overlay vertical scrollbar
   * (one that reduces the width of the viewport): the `vw` (viewport width) unit ignores
   * any reduction of the available space by scrollbars.  A workaround (which I'm
   * currently not using) is `body { overflow-y: scroll; }` [3].  It makes the `vw` unit
   * behave sensibly at the cost of always displaying a scrollbar (and it apparently
   * doesn't work in Chrome and Safari [3]).

# Settings that affect the whole site.  This file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when
# using `bundle exec jekyll serve` -- the server process has to be restarted.

# Site settings.  These are accessed in the HTML files via {{ site.title }},
# {{ site.email }}, and so on.  Any custom variable can be created and will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.my_variable }}.  Some of these are used by
# [jekyll-seo-tag][1].

description: User interface for World of Warcraft

<!-- TODO: special favicon? -->

Primal UI is a highly functional<!--, yet clean and minimal--> user interface for the
World of Warcraft MMOG that is optimized for competitive PvP[^gladiator]
and achieves a consistent, minimal, and clean look without omitting <!-- hiding -->
possibly useful information.
<!-- while showing all possibly useful information. -->
<!-- trading off functionality. -->

It comprises a collection of [original Lua addons](https://github.com/Primal-UI) as well
as configuration for existing addons[^addons] and includes interface elements that are
missing from Blizzard's default UI[^missing] and are typically added with poor visual
integration by addons like [Gladius][].

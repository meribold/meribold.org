MouselookHandler is an interface addon for the World of Warcraft MMOG that adapts the game
controls to enable using [mouselook][] without the [RSI][]-inducing requirement of
perpetually pressing a mouse button.  This makes the controls resemble those of most
action games.

The addon is available on [CurseForge][] and the repository can be found on [GitHub][].
Here's something someone on CurseForge said about MouselookHandler (any emphasis is copied
from the original):

>   Dude this addon is slicker than a greased up pig in a field of eels.

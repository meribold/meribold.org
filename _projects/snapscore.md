SnapScore automates scoring of the board game [*Take It Easy*][] using computer vision.
The user takes a photo of their game board, and SnapScore computes the score.  A basic web
frontend backed by AWS Lambda is available at [snapscore.meribold.org][].

A now-discontinued SnapScore Android app was available on Google Play from 2018 to 2023.
